Analysis of World Wide Historical Soil Data

GEOG490 Soil Project
Project web page for GEOG 490 R for Earth-System Science Soil Data Project
A project exploring a sparse data set, asking an exploratory question about the mean differences in minimum and maximum annual soil respiration values specifically in China, and simulating the bootstrap method to explore the means of those differences:
Parts of this project include:

An Introduction to the Data Set & Nature of the Project:
Who created it
How it was accumulated
Potential problems with the data

Goals
Selecting a subset & exploring the data: Comparing Quality of Data Between Two Countries
Defining a purpose for the data subset
Which feature should we investigate further
Investigating the quality of data

Data Cleaning for an exploratory purpose: Chinaâ€™s Annual Soil Respiration
How do we deal with missing values
Selecting features to answer an exploratory question
Potential problems with the data set now that it is cleaned

Bootstrapping: Estimating Confidence in Mean Differences from 1999 - 2015
What is the bootstrap method
Why would we use it here
The simulated values and associated confidence intervals

Conclusion:
Analysis of Bootstrap simulation
Future thoughts
